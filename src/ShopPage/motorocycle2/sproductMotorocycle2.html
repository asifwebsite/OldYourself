            <h4>1970 Clymer M端nch 1,177cc TTS 'Mammoth'</h4>
            <h2>$154,940 </h2>
            <h4>Item details</h4>
            <span>In 1965 Freidl M端nch, formerly with the Horex racing department, was approached by wealthy French
                ex-sidecar racer Jean Murit with a simple brief: build a no-expense-spared 'superbike', though the
                latter term had yet to be coined. M端nch found his ideal engine in the form of the air-cooled
                overhead-camshaft four powering the recently introduced NSU Prinz car. For Murit's machine he used the
                1,000cc TT sports version of this engine which, tuned for 60bhp, proved capable of propelling the bulky
                Mammoth to a top speed of 120mph. Nothing too remarkable there you might think, but while several
                contemporary production motorcycles could achieve a similar maximum, it was the Mammoth's ability to
                accelerate powerfully from 20mph in top gear and cruise all day at 110mph that set it apart from the
                herd. The engine was housed in a cradle frame inspired by the Manx Norton, and to keep the weight down
                M端nch made extensive use of Elektron magnesium alloy, which was used for the gearbox shell, rear chain
                case, fork sliders, and brakes. The result was a commendably low dry weight for the prototype of 433lbs,
                though production versions would weigh considerably more. Elephant Rally founder and Das Motorrad
                journalist Ernst Leverkus rode the bike in 1966, and the resulting worldwide publicity provoked a rush
                of orders. The production Mammoth (the name would later be dropped for copyright reasons) first appeared
                at the Cologne Show in September 1966, by which time the capacity had risen to 1,085cc, power to 70bhp
                and the top speed close on 140mph. Hand built to individual customer order, the Mammoth eventually used
                the 1,177cc version of the NSU four with power outputs of up to 104bhp.</span>
