            <h4>1948 CHRYSLER TOWN & COUNTRY SEDAN</h4>
            <h2>$68,500</h2>
            <h4>Item details</h4>
            <span>The advent of structural woodwork as an automobile styling feature may not have originated with
                Chrysler, but in the early 1940s, the company’s designers managed to transform this utilitarian feature
                into a status symbol. The earliest woodies were born of necessity, with essential form-after-function
                aftermarket bodies adapted to vehicles like the Model T for commercial duty. Eventually, style points
                began to shape the woodwork, and by the mid-1930s, most American manufacturers offered factory-built
                station wagons with wood bodies. But it was Chrysler’s Town & Country of 1941 that gave the traditional
                utilitarian wood structure a luxurious, elegant makeover. The inspired Town & Country was a
                top-of-the-line luxury car that combined the best of the New Yorker from the windscreen forward with an
                opulent “country home” feel from the cowl back. The T&C was expensive to build, costly to buy, and
                required specialized maintenance, but it proved a success, and soon other manufacturers were jumping on
                the bandwagon with their versions of the luxury woody. However, few could match Chrysler’s stature and
                the sheer sense of occasion when in the presence of one of these magnificent machines.</span>
