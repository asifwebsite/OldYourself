            <h4>1905 STEVENS DURYEA MODEL R</h4>
            <h2>$32,500</h2>
            <h4>Item details</h4>
            <span>Among their many varying interests in the world of car collecting, Frank Kleptz and his son David were
                avid competitors in the Great American Race (now known as The Great Race) during its heyday in the 1980s
                and 1990s. This enormously challenging open road rally is for cars at least 45 years old, pitting
                competitors against the clock, the elements, and against their own machinery over thousands of grueling
                miles. This “regularity rally” requires precision driving, timing, and navigational skills, rewarding
                drivers who arrived at each checkpoint as close to the allotted time as possible. It also tests the
                creativity and will of competitors, who often have to overcome daunting mechanical challenges just to
                stay in the race. The Great Race is a test of physical and mental endurance, as much as it is a test of
                driving prowess.</span>
