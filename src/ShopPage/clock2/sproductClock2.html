            <h4>1960 DUTCH WALL CLOCK</h4>
            <h2>$1,131</h2>
            <h4>Item details</h4>
            <span> It contains an 8-day movement and it chimes on the half and full hour (chimes beautifully).
                This clock works perfectly because this clock is serviced.
                The clock is made in the 1960s.
                The clock is weight driven by two brass weights, which are in excellent condition.
                Furthermore, the ornaments are made of brass, which makes this clock more impressive.
                What is so beautiful about the design of the Sallander clock and also typical for Dutch clocks, is that
                one can
                see the movement of the clock on the side by looking through the glass.
                Of course there are some normal traces of age, but as you can see this luxurious clock is in excellent
                condition.
                Interesting to note is that the pendulum has the form of the sun.
                The height of the clock is about 50 centimeter and the width is 22.5 centimeter.
                In inches: the height is 19" inches, the width is 8" inches.
                Sallander clocks were made in Salland, which is a region in the Netherlands.
                Their design is typical for this region. </span>
