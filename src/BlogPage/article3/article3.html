        <h1>What is Typewriter Art?</h1><br>
        <h4>What is Typewriter art?
        </h4>

        <p>That was my Google Keyword Search when a Gentleman phoned me during the Christmas season of 2017 asking me
            for a typewriter that will type clearly and doesn't have any sticky keys and all that was after introducing
            himself as a "Typewriter Artist". </p>

        <p>So simply, Typewriter art is a form of art that uses a typewriter to draw a picture.
        </p>

        <p>Luckily, he explained to me that he uses his typewriters to draw patterns & simple drawings by clicking a
            certain letter and explained to me that there are many famous & talented Typewriter artists all around the
            world. </p>

        <p>One of the most talented artists are London Based Keira Rathbone & Robert Derfler from Germany. They both
            brilliantly draw faces, buildings and landscapes and i personally follow them on my Instagram and enjoy
            visiting their accounts. </p>
        <p>Picture Below shows the drawing of Frauenkirche in Dresden by Typewriter artist Robert Derfler who was able
            to make sure that his drawing are detailed and realistic to the extent that at the first glance you think
            its a pencil drawing. This art piece was one of his favourites.</p>
        <img src="article3Picture.jpg" width="" alt=""><br><br>

        <p>The Main purpose of my article is not only to share with you the drawings drawn using a typewriter but it is
            to prove that typewriters have been an inspiration for many to draw like wise to people who used it to type
            their stories, letters, and notes.</p>

        <p>The Typewriter will shift you to a new world where you are totally disconnected from the digital world and
            its perfection to a world where mistakes are acceptable and can be a lesson to become better instead of
            being slaves of the digital world that made everything easy and look perfect while leaving us struggling to
            discover our own talents and learning from our mistakes. </p>
