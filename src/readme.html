        <h1>Readme Page</h1>
        <h2>Store name</h2>
        <p>OldYourself</p>
        <h2>What Are You Selling?</h2>
        <p>Vintage items like old cars, motorocycle,record players, typewriter, clocks and more..</p>
        <h2>What additional page(s) did you add? How to operate it?</h2>
        <p>We add Home page, Blog Page, About Page, Contact Page and Admin Page which only the admin can see.</p>
        <p>You can operate them using the navbar (when the admin page is only in the admin navbar).</p>
        <h2> What was hard to do?</h2>
        <p>The most challenging thing was implementing the Login and Signup system with the coockies.
            This system required a lot of new skills that I had to learn and difficult logic through all website's
            pages.
            Another challenging part was to make the shop system work, to connect the DB and find the right way to send
            data and recieving it.
            Finally, the connection between the front and the backend was challenging as well, each specific case
            required specific implementation and all edge cases was challenging to handle.
